Mersenne Twister 19937. {Mode} in link is “Mt”. Numbers are generated by the standard MT19937 algorithm. Seed is “DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds()”. From the 32 bit RNG output discover the seed. Use it to win.  
Lesson to learn: a hard algorithm is not always a secure algorithm. Never seed your RNG with time or any other easily guessable numbers. It will make a strong algorithm weak.
